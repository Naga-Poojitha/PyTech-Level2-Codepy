## 1️⃣ Problem 7 – Pass/Fail Predictor (Classification)

### 📖 Description
This project predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on academic performance using a Machine Learning classification model.

### ⚙️ Implementation Details
- Created a target column:
  - Pass if average score ≥ 40
  - Fail otherwise
- Used 80% training and 20% testing split
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Displayed:
  - Training and testing sample size
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
- Implemented interactive prediction using user input
- Modular structure using OOP (`main.py` + `model.py`)
